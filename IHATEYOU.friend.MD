  ## Challenges
  One of the biggest challenges during this project was getting the bloopdy Post routes and insomnia to work and cooperate. Turns out some files were not properly referenced and it was fun relearning proofreading just to do so. Some of the stuff i can't finish becasue i need to do the modules and future assignements (oops) but oh well i just hope i do ok.

  This is an example of one of the issues from insomnia where the cause was that I didn't type in the `{params}, res`. Example of having good typing skills and not forgetting anything.
